0.7;DNA sequencing is a method used to determine the precise order of the four nucleotide bases â€“ adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine - that make up a strand of DNA.
13.9;These bases provide the underlying genetic makeup (the genotype).
19.1;Now that you have isolated the DNA, place this within the nanopore sequencer.
25.3;You will need to calibrate the sequencer by manually matching the first few base pairs.
31.9;Once the nanopore sequencer is properly calibrated it will rapidly measure the entire genetic code of the organism and be able to display it.
