0.8;You can use the logic board to keep track of all of your findings in one place.
6.2;All the information that has been provided for you can be found on the board.
11.2;It is up to you to connect the results and find links in your experimental findings.
16.4;As you conduct your experiments, the results should be kept track of on the board and you can choose whether any connections form.
24.2;If you direct your attention to the logic board, you will notice that there are center blocks that will represent each core experiment and test conducted.
33.6;Each center block will have 4 slots surrounding it in which evidence, screen shots and anything else useful may be placed.
42.7;Consider this a form of note taking.
45.5;It will be up to you to determine what pathogens and evidence to reject and what to keep track of.
52.3;If you at any point determine a pathogen as a negative or believe you have found the correct one, you can refer to your logic board to double check these findings.
62.5;Keep in mind that some data may be present in the database if needed, but not presented elsewhere.
