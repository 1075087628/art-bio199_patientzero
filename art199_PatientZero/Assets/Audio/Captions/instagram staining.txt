0.7;Determining whether a pathogen is gram negative or positive is an essential property to know as it will help with your goal to identify the unknown pathogen.
12.9;Instagram staining is a new innovative protocol adopted from a previous technique known as gram staining.
19.7;This procedure allows scientists to determine if a bacteria is gram positive or gram negative much faster than before.
27.6;This is due to a newly synthesized stain known as the IGS stain.
35.4;Based on your file we realize this technique is novel to you.
39.3;Therefore, I will walk you through it step by step.
42.5;Step 1: Add a droplet of water directly to the slide with a disposable pipette.
51.1;Step 2: Sterilize the inoculating loop by heating it with a bunsen burner.
57.2;This step is crucial as it is important to minimize cross contamination.
63;Step 3: With the sterilized inoculating loop, scoop a sample of the isolated bacteria and add it to the droplet of water you placed on the slide.
75.5;Step 4: Wait for the water droplet to dry.
79.7;An alternative method would be to heat fix the sample by passing the slide through the fire of the bunsen burner.
87.8;Step 5: Once the slide is dry, flood the slide with IGS stain and set aside for 30 seconds.
97.8;Step 6: Rinse the IGS stain with water and pat dry with a wipe.
105.8;Step 7: Place the slide in the microscope and use the hologram feature to determine if the bacteria is gram positive, which will be shown as purple, or gram negative, which will be pink.
