0.8;Equipped with the entire genetic code of this unknown pathogen, the next step is determining what it is most similar to in order to determine the best treatment.
11.3;The facility has the genetic sequence of the known pathogens for comparison.
16.7;You will need to interact with the displays and select the one with the highest degree of certainty.
22.8;The unknown pathogensâ€™ genetic code is displayed in yellow.
26.9;Compare this with the known ones and select what you believe to be the original strain.
33;Now that you have selected what you believe to be the correct pathogen you must be sure in order for the necessary resources to be allotted to solutions.
42.2;Refer to the final batch of information coming from the planet and determine with certainty what you believe is the correct pathogen.
