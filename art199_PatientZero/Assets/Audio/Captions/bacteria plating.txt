0.8;Bacterial plating is a technique that allows researchers to grow a surplus of bacteria from one sample.
7.8;By having a surplus, researchers can perform multiple experiments to study the characteristics of an unknown bacteria.
16.7;Step 1: Obtain and label a solid media plate.
22.1;Step 2: Obtain and heat an inoculating loop to sterilize it to avoid contamination from other microorganisms.
33;Step 3: Afterwards, collect a small amount from the stool sample and isolate with the sterilized inoculating loop.
43.1;Step 4: Gently streak the collected sample across the solid media plate.
49.9;Finally, place the media plate within the incubator to spur the growth.
