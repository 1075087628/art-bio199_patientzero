0.2;DNA isolation is a routine procedure used to isolate DNA, the genetic material, from the nucleus of the bacteria.
8.8;Step 1: Obtain the petri dish with the bacteria and insert it into the Cell Analyzer
16;Step 2: Turn the Cell Analyzer on to project a hologram of the bacteria cell.
22;You can now move the bacteria around with your hands.
26.3;Step 3: You will now proceed with cell lysis, which is used to chemically break open the bacterial cell to release the DNA.
34.9;In order to look closely into the bacteria, you need to lysate it using the Lysate button.
42.1;Step 5: Now you have the option to choose between lysing the cell chemically or mechanically.
48.4;Chemical cell lysis uses chemical agents to disrupt the lipid membrane of the bacteria and force the cell to release its contents (such as protein and organelles).
58.4;Mechanical cell lysis is much more forceful with the use of rotating blades to grind and disperse the contents.
65.9;Step 6: Now you can see the chemicals from the vials running into the Cell Analyzer.
72.6;Step 7: You are now able to have a closer look into the various components of the bacteria cell.
79.2;You need to find which one of these components contains the DNA of the bacteria.
83.9;You can do that by reading the description of each componentâ€™s function
88.7;Step 8: Please identify the DNA and isolate it by grabbing and removing it from the bacteria cell.
